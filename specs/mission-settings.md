# Mission settings

Configure your drone model, camera, altitude reference, and safety options for the mission.

## What you can do

- **Choose your drone model**: M300 RTK, M350 RTK, M30/M30T, M30 Dock, Mavic 3E/3T/3M/3D/3TD, Mini 4 Pro.
- **Choose a camera/payload** available for the selected drone.
- **See the flight app compatibility** for the selected drone: DJI Pilot/Pilot 2 or DJI Fly.
- **Set a global flight speed** and takeoff security height.
- **Choose a height reference**:
  - Relative to start point.
  - EGM96 (MSL) — altitude above mean sea level.
  - Above ground level.
- **Set what happens when the mission ends**: go home, land automatically, return to the first waypoint, or hover.
- **Set what happens if the remote controller connection is lost**: return home, land, or hover.
- **Set the transit speed** (speed used to fly to the first waypoint).
- **Set maximum battery minutes** so the app can warn you if the estimated flight time exceeds your battery capacity.

## How it works

1. Open the mission settings panel in the sidebar.
2. Select your drone and camera.
3. Check the flight app shown for that drone.
4. Adjust altitude reference, speeds, and safety options.
5. The app uses these settings when exporting the mission file and when calculating flight time estimates.

## Good to know

- DJI Fly drones use a different KMZ layout from DJI Pilot/Pilot 2 drones.
- DroneRoute chooses the export layout from the selected drone model, not from the raw DJI enum values inside a KMZ file.

## Good to know

- The available cameras change depending on which drone you select.
- If the estimated flight time exceeds the battery limit you set, a warning appears.
- Height reference affects how altitude values are interpreted by the drone — choose the one that matches your operational needs. The default is **above ground level**.
- All height fields enforce a minimum of 1 meter.
